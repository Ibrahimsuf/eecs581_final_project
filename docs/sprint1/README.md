# Sprint 1 Requirements Artifacts

This folder contains the artifacts for the Sprint 1 requirement: a KU Jobs scraper that fetches and prints core job fields from https://employment.ku.edu/jobs using requests + BeautifulSoup.

Contents:
- requirement_R2_web_scraper.md — the artifact for the Sprint 1 requirement, with acceptance criteria, verification steps, and traceability.
- test_plan.md — concise test scenarios to validate the requirement.
- sample_run_output.txt — a saved example of the script’s console output.

How to verify quickly:
1) Ensure dependencies are installed (see repository README).
2) Run the scraper and visually compare with sample_run_output.txt.
